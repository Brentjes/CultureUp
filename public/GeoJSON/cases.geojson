The pole has been nicknamed Point Nemo, after author Jules Verne's famous Captain Nemo. The name also means \"no-one\" in Latin, which is fitting because Point Nemo is so far from land, that the nearest humans are often astronauts. The International Space Station orbits the Earth at a maximum of 258 miles (416 km), meanwhile the nearest landmass is Ducie Island, an uninhabited atoll in the Pitcairn Islands, over 1,670 miles (2,700 km) away.",
