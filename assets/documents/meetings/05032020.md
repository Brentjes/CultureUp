## Meeting 05/03/2020

#### Agenda
- What research has been done? As a consequence of that data, can we conclude that this is a good idea? Where is the data? Is your research reliable and did it follow the scientific method? What type of research did you do? In case you ran a couple of polls, did you carry them out properly? Were a lot of people asked the same questions? Was there no tampering with your findings in any way? 
- Are students themselves interested in this?
- How flexible are you in creativity if it turns out that this game is not the right solution, or not viable?
- If the client still wants this game: it will be very static if we use only pictures and some videos. 
- It will require a lot of time and effort to have actors on camera, will this be doable to obtain within the weeks that we have, and then also make a game out of this?
