##Meeting 02/03/2020

- Project for HZ Community
- Cultural drive: resilient & flexible
- Communicative competence
- Should be flexible in terms of cases (new case to be added easily)
- Forum
- Let student upload videos themselves
- Create group chat in Teams
- Ajax would be a possibility in terms of tools

The general idea of the client is to create an interactive game to develop communicative skills in students from different cultures. 
An example would be a case where a German and a Chinese business have meetings, but the communication is hard. Student would have to walk through the game together.
